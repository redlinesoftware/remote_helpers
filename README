Note
-------------------
Last time I checked this plugin was incompatible with the unobtrusive javascript plugin as it overrides one of the same methods this plugin does. I'll work on a fix to this soon hopefully, but in the mean time, watch out for it.

Updates
-------------------

Dec. 5, 2006 - Added two additional methods, indicator_options and indicator_image, to allow for more flexible indicators.  See the api for more details.
Eg. <%= content_tag 'div', 'Updating Data... ' + indicator_image, indicator_options %>

Nov. 16, 2006 - If using the :disable_form option (set to true by default), the form is now disabled after the ajax request is made, not before. This change is required due to a change in prototype so make sure to update to the latest version of this plugin.

Sept. 27, 2006 - Auto form disable when using the :submit option with remote_function. The :disable_form option can be used to prevent this.

See Rdoc for more up to date information. Information here is a quick summary and may also be out of date.

All remote actions are automatically enabled to show a gui indicator during a remote call with this plugin.

Examples
-------------------
- To disable the gui indicator
<%= remote_function :url => {:action => 'dosomething'}, :indicator => false %>

- To use the default values
<%= remote_function :url => {:action => 'dosomething'} %> <%= indicator %>

- To use a custom :id
<%= remote_function :url => {:action => 'dosomething'}, :indicator => 'custom' %> <%= indicator :id => 'custom' %>

- Using many indicators on the same page
<% collection.each do |id| %>
<%= link_to_remote :url => {:action => 'dosomething'}, :indicator => "link#{id}" %>
<%= indicator :id => "link#{id}" %>
<% end %>

Defaults are also provided which can be overridden.

The default image name to use:
default_image = 'indicator.gif'

The default id that's used:
default_id = 'indicator'

See the enclosed README for more information.

**IMPORTANT GOTCHA**
Don't forget to use <%= indicator %> on the page with remote calls or the javascript will fail and your action won't complete (In development mode you will be shown an alert if the indicator has not been defined). This doesn't apply if you have used the :indicator => false option.

Additional Form Methods
-----------------------
Both the form_remote_tag and submit_to_remote methods disable their associated
form by default during a remote call. This is useful to prevent a user from
submitting a form twice while a remote call is in progress.

To prevent this from occuring use the :disable_form option and set it to false
(default is true).

eg.) form_remote_tag(:url => {:action => 'dosomething'}, :disable_form => false)
